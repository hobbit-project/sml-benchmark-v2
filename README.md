# Structured machine learning benchmark v2
Source codes of Structured Machine Learning Benchmark v2 (used for [DEBS Grand Challenge 2018](https://project-hobbit.eu/challenges/debs2018-grand-challenge/)). 

The 2018 DEBS Grand Challenge focuses on the application of machine learning to spatio-temporal streaming data. The goal of the challenge is to make the naval transportation industry more reliable by providing predictions for vessels' destinations and arrival times. Predicting both correct destinations and arrival times of vessels are relevant problems, that once solved, will boost the efficiency of the overall supply chain management.
